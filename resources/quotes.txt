Hello
Goodbye
I'm sorry
I love you

Please stop
Please don't do that
Don't do that
Don't look behind
Don't look inside
Don't open the box
Don't open the door
Oops
Beg
Why?
Outpost removed
Outpost destroyed
I didn't expect you so soon
Wasn't there an outpost here?
You've been here before
You're going in circles
I'm glad to see you're back
You don't want the seeker to win
I can't stop thinking about killing you
Would you like to see a magic trick?
Want to see a magic trick?
I tried to save you
I really tried
Do your best, it's not enough
Did something just move?
You're so close
I see you
I'm watching
Smile, I'm watching you
I'm behind you
Watch your step
The water is cold
I crave a human
One bite at a time
Who are you?
Are you ok?
They're here
It's alive
It's coming
It's near
The time is near
I put a spell on you
This place is cursed
No one escapes alive
You will plead to escape
Sometimes dead is better
Even the dead tell stories
Sacrifice them
Be afraid
Fear may save you
Feel free to scream
Do you want to play a game?
Wanna play?
You will die
You're doomed
At least your bones will survive
A little bit of torture goes a long way
May I pop your pimples?
Everything must go
Why am I violent
The skin is the best part
Spaghetti slide ahead
The gravy boat is full
Potato
The answer is potato
May I borrow your milk
Only 9 toes left
Jar of thumbs
Jar of eyeballs
I didn't do it
Sleep at your own risk
